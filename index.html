    But instead of finding sanctuary within its walls, she and dozens of others -- men, women and children -- became targets. Both her children were shot but survived. At least a dozen people didn't.
    "It was the Russians and the FACA [the CAR army]," Fatouma said.</p>
    <p>Russian mercenaries, supported by at least one combat helicopter, attacked the neighborhood as they hunted for rebels known as the Seleka. But according to multiple witnesses, they opened fire indiscriminately against civilians, many of them hiding at the al Taqwa mosque.
    "There was not a single Seleka element found in the mosque," Fatouma said. "It was just the civilian population that they killed. We didn't even see a dead Seleka body on the ground, it was our children they killed."
    CNN has changed the names of witnesses and victims to protect them from possible retribution.
    Other local sources say there may have been two Seleka taking refuge in the mosque, but they were unarmed.</p>
